# Image Classification


Image classification refers to the task of assigning a single label or class to an input image based on its content. The goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately categorize images into predefined classes or categories. Each image is associated with a single class label, representing the object, scene, or concept depicted in the image.

Image classification is a fundamental problem in computer vision and has a wide range of applications. Some examples include:

(1) Object recognition: Identifying specific objects or entities within images, such as cars, animals, or landmarks.
Scene classification: Categorizing images based on the type of scene they represent, such as beach, mountain, cityscape, or forest.

(2) Medical image analysis: Diagnosing medical conditions based on medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs, or histopathology slides.

(3) Document analysis: Classifying documents based on their content, such as identifying handwritten digits or different types of documents (invoices, forms, letters).

Image classification is typically approached by DLN. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used for image classification due to their ability to learn hierarchical features from image data. The models are trained on labeled datasets, where images are manually annotated with their corresponding class labels. During training, the model learns to extract relevant features from the images and map them to the correct class labels. Once trained, the model can predict the class label of unseen images.

The performance of an image classification model is evaluated based on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, which measure the model's ability to correctly classify images from a test dataset.

Overall, image classification plays a crucial role in various real-world applications that require automated understanding and interpretation of visual data.
