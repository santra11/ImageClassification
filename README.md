# Object detection


Object detection is a computer vision technique that identifies and localizes objects of interest within an image. The goal of object detection is to locate the position of one or more objects within an image or a video and classify them into predefined categories.

Object detection is a critical task in many applications, such as self-driving cars, surveillance, and robotics. Object detection algorithms use deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), to identify and localize objects in images or videos. These algorithms typically involve two main stages: object localization and object classification.

In the object localization stage, the algorithm identifies the location of an object within an image or video frame. This is typically done using bounding boxes, which are rectangles that tightly enclose the object. In the object classification stage, the algorithm assigns a label or category to the object, such as "car," "person," or "dog," based on its visual characteristics.

Overall, object detection is a complex and challenging task that requires sophisticated computer vision algorithms and large amounts of labeled training data.
